# worktime-react-native

Simple time calculator.

I have exactly the same app which 
I built in 2018 with Java, but this time using React Native.
At my previous work, I had to write down my start, end, lunch time and
calculate the total working time every day. If it was simple like 9am - 5pm, 
I would not bother trying to make this app. However, when you came in 
8:42 am, left at 5:47 pm and 29 mins for lunch? You want one of this.
